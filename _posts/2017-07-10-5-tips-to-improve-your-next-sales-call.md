### 1. Do your prep homework prior to the call.

Let’s be honest - we know you’re busy and scrambling to meet your monthly and quarterly quota. Calls keep coming in. Be sure you know your call schedule for the day and have researched beforehand. As you know, call prep is a must in today’s environment. And you can never be too prepared.

Hubspot’s 2017 Sales & Marketing Report cites 63 percent of prospects are “somewhat” or “not at all” knowledgeable about a company before a sales rep makes the first contact. It may seem like a no-brainer to visit your prospect’s company website prior to the call, but it’s an important component of your pre-call research.

Utilize social media as a vital sales prep tool. Go to the company and even prospect’s social media pages. Capture these key details:

* Title
* Company size
* Industries served
* Who is the decision maker?
* Find something unique that stands out

### 2. Follow your playbook.

Stay organized throughout the call and be clear from the beginning your agenda for the call. Prospects have busy schedules and distractions facing them like their email, coworkers stopping by their desk Make the conversation personal from the beginning. Have your messaging in front of you throughout the call.

* Introduction
* Agenda
* Goals and Current State
* Discovery
* Timeline
* Next Steps

### 3. Ask the right questions at the right times.

Follow a logical method of asking questions. Start broad and then narrow in on necessary details. Listen for keywords and details that may lead to the next appropriate question and build on each response.

###
<br>4. Actively listen and document key notes.

Practice active listening throughout the call to gather information you need to properly qualify the candidate or propose an offer that fits. Pay attention to what the prospect is telling you and treat every question as a learning experience. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

### 5. Don’t forget to follow up.

Every call should end with a next steps conversation. Whether you have an immediate action item or not, you should reconnect with your prospect. 80 percent of sales require 5 follow-up calls after the meeting. Have a system in place to simplify follow up actions. Ensure your follow up is timely. Don’t wait days or even weeks to reach out to the prospect after the call. Even if it’s a short note, make sure to send an email, social media message or text to keep the conversation going.
