**Sales Team Must Adapt to Succeed and Close More Deals**
<br>Sales teams must change their processes to catch up with this period of rapid transformation. Inside sales is the fastest growing area of sales and the dominant model. They need to adapt to the changing world and buyer expectations now. They can no longer use ad-hoc solutions like handwritten notepads, Excel, Dropbox, Evernote, emails or messaging apps to maintain discovery call information and share opportunity analysis and collateral.

Sales managers face tougher challenges today than ever before. They have six or more direct reports on average. Their quotas continue to grow. It’s become incredibly challenging to juggle coaching reps, training new reps, reporting win/loss analysis to management and more. On top of that, often times, the sales performance tracking model and tools currently at their disposal do not provide accurate insights into the entire pipeline. How can they properly predict future trends and make decisions based on limited insight?

**Making the Shift to a New Sales Process**
<br>Sales engagement is a growing trend, but what is it exactly? Sales engagement tools help reps reach savvy buyers in the digitally world, ask more insightful questions and actively manage the selling experience. These tools simplify the seller’s job and give them more time for human interaction. The shift is to a technology for efficiency, removing the routine tasks and fixing the manager visibility problem. Managers can make decisions based on metrics instead of hunches. Real-time intelligent insights gives managers a better way to mentor, coach and manager sales reps.

**Sales Process Evolution**
<br>The sales engagement tools present an opportunity for sales teams to manage every stage of the sales cycle while aligning with CRM and marketing tools already in place. Integrating a sales engagement tool also helps bridge the gap between sales and marketing. This gives them a central repository to ensure all current/latest marketing collateral is being used from properly branded presentations to relevant testimonials and case studies.

Companies should consider implementing a dedicated sales enablement or engagement position or department within their organization. This technology is only one part of the equation for winning in today’s ever changing marketplace.
